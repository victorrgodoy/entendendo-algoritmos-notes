### Topics
- **Big O**: Analyzing the speed and complexity of algorithms.
- **Binary Search**: A searching algorithm with O(log2n) complexity.
- **Selection Sort**: A sorting algorithm with O(nÂ²) complexity.
- **Recursion**: Functions that call themselves to solve problems.
- **Quicksort**: An efficient sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that maps keys to values.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Finds the shortest path between two points in a graph.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest time or cost path between two points in a graph.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Algorithms that make locally optimal choices in the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **Dynamic Programming**: A technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
